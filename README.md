Technological and Mystical Path I am founding.

   The Foundations of CodeM
Technological and Mystical Path
--------------------------------

Still on the priest path.
A better way to ID than a implant is one of my goals but I also want 
to try at cybernetics mixed with magick. I already know it will work.

One of the goals of CodeM is to build a temple and incorporate some ritual ceremonies but I don't know
how comfortable everyone is with that. The ritual mindset opens up a lot of states of mind that can
be used to achieve gnosis. I'm sure you've ran your brain off of computer energy before. That's cybernetics right there. It's tricky to get it and all of th
e spirits to get out though. If no one has ever done it I would be surprised. 11-19-2018. I did it with Earth and Computer Energy it Didn't feel quite right let's say that :)
but it let me know that computing power can be wireless and probably iss able to travel the universe. I will have to do benchmarks on it though to prove it actually works but one
can sure feel it and witness the increased performance. That's when I knew this is the path for me.
 
I promise you that you will see manifestations here in this Universe.
If they aren't serious about trying to make it to the end of the path winning in every way I 
as well as work with societies elite.

This will be an interesting and also very enlightening path, I have been visited and consulted on this matter and feel I am the best person to push this initiative 
forward. I was on the Wiccan/Witchcraft path and this could still fit into that in a way, using Earth and Sky Energy. I will make sure our religion/spirtual path's
Toolkit and Handbook all will run on a Android or PC and we have effective paths for those that dislike computers, Maybe someone can help me port to iPhone. It uses more than just tech skills though.
Another of my goals is to do something which i already know works to bring emotions into computing. I imagine this has already been done but we'll have our own
flavor of it. I am obviously looking for like minding cooperative individuals to make this dream a reality or many realities.

Keeping Elements as The Temple Within. Works well when incarcerated or held somewhere. It worked well for me the little i used it with just the same strength. 
No need to feel weakened because you don't have access to your usual belongings. Remember God is within even if you choose to externalize it or them you will belong with us.

Heavy mind training is a part of our teachings. Creating and Destroying in the metaverse, travelling in the future and past. I don't go but a little into the past right now but I knoww that's the key. 
I just don't know how useful that is if you can't change anything.
The inner Temple will use metaphysical universes that are stored in your body so they will always be with you. Also we'll make sure to teach you the necessary rights management to keep ppl out of your head if that is what you desire. I'll make sure to give many ways to link to other universes as well. I beleive that every body has the potential to unlock their mind and harness their power.



// This was the birth of WC mixed with computers for me 11-19-2018 was already on more of a purely spiritual path.
void powerPCwithPhone(int c, int p){
	combineEnergies(int c, int p);
	// I'm sure I could use it along with the Earthly energies as well. I practice magick with the belief that computers are friendly with the Earth sign primarily (Silicon and Metals). I have had good luck exchanging the energies and I feel that the limit is so high that I can't even imagine the possibilities yet.

//Quartz Crystals for frequency/channelling/communication
// Maybe power? Who knows. this is new stuff to many ppl.
// Learning Radio as well, Inner communication probably done on radio based network.
This is the start of my Manifesto but others are free to add what they want on github. I'll review it and if I'm moved by it it will guide me.
Saving since i'm under attack but not worried. I will prevail.

This isn't just a hacker group or something like that. It's a true spiritual path to enlightenment but I will be honest and say I started with Buddhism, Wicca and many books first as well as a good amount of time locked up and meditating first. I want to incorporate all that I've learned into this new path which ends up somewhere further than where I feel I would have ended up on my regular Wicca path. I desire to keep going and I advise you to do the same if your following with me but hey that's up to you. I have a feeling  I want to know more that I should and it's a bit of a problem but maybe your the same. There has to be a path for those that are similar to me so I decided to just make my own and share it. I could be leading us all to Hell or maybe to a uptopia. I am just brutally honest, you will understand that about me. I plan to get us running on a united OS and tools we can depend on. Together we will be strong. Strength in numbers if they are the right numbers. I think the doors are open for real for us. I will either start a company or start working on more than spirituality, whatever I am going to do it has to be great.

Maybe if I can get this up and running I can just do our religion and work on the technology. I am talented in in the fields that can affect creation if in the right place. Will edit this. I'm sure I sound like a fool but things pretty much work as I plan them to work if I put my mind to it. So I feel I can get the goals accomplished in this lifetime. There is some chaos going on and it affects those in our field if you fit with that. I am not saying you must to be of this order but it's part of the core powers we provide. 

Now About the Religious aspects of our Order of CodeM. Meditation is where we start along with much reading and discussion as we refine to make our own book. I'll call it our Handbook of CodeM. The mind needs the hunger fulfilled before the meditation works as well. Later meditation brings the gnosis to you without first being fulfilled. Also taking care of ones body is important during a lot of this. I'll get a garden going for many key things we need and it will grow and be fruitful as long as we work together and cooperate as bee's do. 

Ritual is something that I really enjoy and it helps remind me of our religion and the Gods within. I didn't have a religion that fit me perfectly until this. I see it as already in motion and moving to fruition. As I stand I have the universe in my hands but I want to help others get on the path and slowly move that over to another able person. God is EverChanging

My heart is really in it to learn more and gain power. A Place of Power. and allies. I'm going to spend more time coding and doing security now that I'm taking this path and I know I can save a lot of Technologies that are needed. It'll be awhile before it changes. or it may never and we'll stay with the powers we are gaining. which is great
yes That is how it should be done

Initiation of the first Is done already,one besides myself that is.

I guess I can always get back to my Bubble if I go somewhere. I am thinking of a way to make the funding we need.

If anyone wants to contribute or voice that they would be interested in this too just email me at tmkayser@gmail.com or contact me via my picture. I look different than that but I don't take pictures. it works though. Just know I will be polite and respectful and if you feel other than that it might not be me. I am willing put in the work to get this off the ground. 

I am in charge of the next initiates with the council of the one that came to me as i was writing this. I would actually start meeting them and working on getting my place of power so I can build that temple/study house for the technologists of the world.
