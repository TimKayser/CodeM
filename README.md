   The Foundations of CodeM
Technological and Mystical Path
--------------------------------

Still on the priest path.
A better way to ID than a implant is one of my goals but I also want 
to try at cybernetics mixed with magick. I already know it will work.

One of the goals of CodeM is to build a temple and incorporate some ritual ceremonies but I don't know
how comfortable everyone is with that. The ritual mindset opens up a lot of states of mind that can
be used to achieve gnosis. I'm sure you've ran your brain off of computer energy before. That's cybernetics right there. It's tricky to get it and all of th
e spirits to get out though. If no one has ever done it I would be surprised. 11-19-2018. I did it with Earth and Computer Energy it Didn't feel quite right let's say that :)
but it let me know that computing power can be wireless and probably iss able to travel the universe. I will have to do benchmarks on it though to prove it actually works but one
can sure feel it. It causes computers to visibly run faster my phone ran off my computer and vice versa. That's when I knew this is the path for me.
 
I promise you that you will see manifestations here in this Universe.
If they aren't serious about trying to make it to the end of the path winning in every way I 
as well as work with societies elite.

This will be an interesting and also very enlightening path, I have been visited and consulted on this matter and feel I am the best person to push this initiative 
forward. I was on the Wiccan/Witchcraft path and this could still fit into that in a way, using Earth and Sky Energy. I will make sure our religion/spirtual path's
Toolkit and Handbook all will run on a Android or PC, Maybe someone can help me port to iPhone. It uses more than just tech skills though.
Another of my goals is to do something which i already know works to bring emotions into computing. I imagine this has already been done but we'll have our own
flavor of it. I am obviously looking for like minding cooperative individuals to make this dream a reality or many realities.

Keeping Elements as The Temple Within. Works well when incarcerated or held somewhere. It worked well for me the little i used it with just the same strength. 
No need to feel weakened because you don't have access to your usual belongings. Remember God is within even if you choose to externalize it or them you will belong with us.

Heavy mind training is a part of our teachings. Creating and Destroying in the metaverse, travelling in the future and past. I don't go but a little into the past right now but I knoww that's the key. 
I just don't know how useful that is if you can't change anything.
The inner Temple will use metaphysical universes that are stored in your body. I'll make sure to give many ways to link to other universes as well. I beleive that every body has the potential to unlock their mind and harness their power.



// This was the birth of WC mixed with computers for me 11-19-2018 was already on more of a purely spiritual path.
void powerPCwithPhone(int c, int p){
	combineEnergies(int c, int p);
	// I'm sure I could use it along with the Earthly energies as well. I practice magick with he belief that computers are friendly with the Earth sign primarily (Silicon and Metals). I have had good luck exchanging the energies and I feel that the limit is so high that I can't even imagine the possibilities yet.

//Quartz Crystals for frequency/channelling/communication
// Maybe power? Who knows. this is new stuff to many ppl.
// Learning Radio as well, Inner communication probably done on radio based network.
This is the start of my Manifesto but others are free to add what they want on github. I'll review it and if I'm moved by it it will guide me.
Saving since i'm under attack but not worried. I will prevail.
